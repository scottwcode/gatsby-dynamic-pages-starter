There are social media profiles for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, and Pinterest, but they aren�۪t used for driving traffic to the site.

The Seller has a team of six employees in place who manage most of the operations for the business, including customer service, fulfillment support and graphic design. The Seller spends about 10 hours per week on the business, doing a weekly accounting review for each business and managing the staff. The employees are unaware of the sale, but the Seller is confident they will continue with the Buyer since they are remote.    * These businesses could be sold separately, but packaging them together allows the Buyer to qualify for an SBA loan.

Social media accounts associated with the brand include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Instagram has the largest following with over 600k followers in total. The pages are integral to the core of the business and content it shares.    The business procured hundreds of videos from influencers and videographers when it first launched. They still chop up new videos and make different edits to existing raw footage on a monthly basis.��Due to the nature of��the main product, new content is generated organically on Instagram, YouTube, Snap, and Twitter. This content is then used in advertisements. Additionally, the��brand has been written about on major sites and had numerous free celebrity/athlete endorsements.    The associated email list has over 300k subscribers. There is also an SMS campaign list with over 200k members. These are not currently��being monetized, making them growth opportunities for the Buyer to consider.    When it comes to work required for maintaining this business, everything is done in-house except fulfillment/storage which is handled��by a 3PL company. There are 2 dedicated employees currently��working on this specific business ��� one for customer service and one for marketing.    * The Seller's agency��is willing to continue handling any or all of the daily/weekly tasks for the Buyer at an agreed upon rate.��More information can be provided to active depositors.

    "long_descr": "This listing is for a dropshipping and ecommerce business created in December 2015 in the jewelry &amp; accessories niche. The Shopify site primarily features unique jewelry, with over 1500 products currently��listed and more added every day. Three VAs help make the store run on automated systems, so the Seller can spend minimal time working on the business. With 260K+ social followers and a strong email list of 220K+, this business has a clear path outlined for growth.    As a marketing strategy, the business has used Facebook to promote the store and its products. The hard work and development have paid off and��these days the Facebook advertising works sustainably, almost on auto-pilot. Thanks to the large following, the Seller can spot��the winning posts published on the page and then create paid campaigns for them. These tasks could be delegated to one of the VAs as well if the Buyer wished to do so.    The VAs handle the vast majority of order fulfillment, customer service, Facebook posting and day-to-day operations. They also process the fulfillment of any orders that come in for a jewelry line that is not dropshipped. This line is stored with FBA, though sold only on the Shopify site. This process is made even smoother with procedures and tools like Zendesk in place. This allows the Seller to focus on paid ads, email marketing, and the high-level tasks of company finances and managing the VAs.    It is worth noting, the Buyer does not need to be a Facebook marketing \"expert\" to continue to be successful with Facebook advertising. The Seller feels they will be able to easily train the Buyer on how to do it and how to continue the same processes, and it will not take much time.    While most of the traffic is from social, a nice 15% is direct traffic that seems to be from returning users, and almost 10% is from organic traffic without any SEO efforts being made. This is an opportunity for the Buyer to expand. With such a large internal audience, the Seller suggests that the best opportunity for growth is to focus on the email list as it much easier, and significantly cheaper, to generate revenue from existing customers than it is to find new customers.    *The Seller is including in the sale, a subscription box service that was launched in December of 2017. This part of the business has been managed by the Seller's��partner��and is in the same niche. This subscription box service has its own website, customers, and email list, and some cross-marketing is done with the main site as it is a nice complimentary service. The subscription box service can be separated and operated as a business on its own. As the profits from this new venture continue to grow, the Seller suggests the new owner outsource this work to an employee to help the subscription service expand quickly. Since its launch, it's brought in around 10% of the revenue for the business.    *In February 2016, PayPal limited the ability to receive payments to the PayPal account. In response, the Seller created a new LLC company and a new PayPal account specifically for this business. This account is active and in good standing to this day.    *In November 2017��Facebook deactivated the Business Manager account because of ads run on a different ecommerce��profile (unrelated niche). Even though the Ads Account of this business was separate, the access to this account was restricted��as well. After a few weeks of reorganization, the Seller opened a new Ads Account solely for this business, which is working well and in good standing to this day.

The Seller��quickly re-purposed their designs for the Amazon marketplace and other secondary POD marketplaces to further monetize inventory. Almost 45k designs are��live on Amazon with a limit of 56k design slots available.    Outside of Amazon, the site earns revenue from a branded Shopify site and other print-on-demand marketplaces such as RedBubble, Etsy, TeeSpring, Spreadshirt, CafePress, and more. These secondary channels make up about a quarter of overall monthly profit. Numerous social media profiles have been created to market the products and several email lists exist across the platforms. The main email list from the Shopify site has about 2k subscribers and has been emailed occasionally with offers.    While the Seller has primarily relied on organic traffic on Amazon, social media and AMS ads have also contributed.��The Merch by Amazon account is approved to run ads in the Amazon UK and Germany marketplaces where monthly sales are already taking place.    The Seller has recently spent their time on the business re-purposing existing designs onto new products made available on the various platforms. This amounts to about 5 to 15 hours per week. Buyers interested in growing the business further may wish to follow this path and continue uploading older designs for new product types.��For new designs, the Seller creates some themselves, but has also used one designer for over 2 years. They've used outsourced employees intermittently over the past 3 years and is happy to pass along details for them to the Buyer.    * Merch by Amazon��reports numbers for the previous month during the latter part of the following month, so��some stats may be delayed below.    * Since this is a design-based business, the Seller has occasionally received rejections, notices, take down requests, cease and desist letters, etc. related to their designs. They've��reconciled issues,��typically removing designs instead of fighting it unless it was a false notice. These don't happen often and have occurred without noticeable affects to account standings.��The MBA ecosystem, for one, is ever changing and many sellers file for trademarks on phrases. In doing so, they file take down notices against sellers that are already selling a product with the exact phrase.  See the link for more details regarding earnings and traffic.",

The company has a strong customer base, a well-trained team, and a reputation as a leader in the field.  Although based in the Dallas, TX area, the company has done major projects all across the United States and can be relocated anywhere.    About the company    Advanced Pipe Repair was started in the summer of 2006 when the current owner discovered a new technology being used in Europe changing the way pipes are restored.  Using a technology called CIPP (Cured in Place Pipe) a sleeve is put inside a pipe and then through a process cured in place.  This allows large diameter pipes to be repaired without the expensive and invasive process of digging.    Over the last 12 years Advanced Pipe Repair serves mid-size commercial businesses completing hundreds of jobs ranging from $10,000 to $300,000.  They have built a well-trained, small team that understand the technology and are skilled in the process.  They pride themselves in being able to think outside the box bringing solutions to their customers that result in superior results for less money.    About the products    CIPP ��� This has been the bread and butter for Advanced Pipe Repair.  Cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) is a trenchless (or no-dig) pipeline rehabilitation process involving a textile liner tube and liquid resin combination.    Epoxy ��� This is another ���no dig�۝ solutions used for pipes with more turns and bends.  It is a simpler method for smaller jobs.",

Property should enjoy tremendous growth in the next couple of years based on the number of new homes and apartments being developed.  Dallas County recently purchased the 11acres diagonally across the street and are building a 69,000 sq foot building for courthouses and offices, which will mean a lot more cars and will make this intersection one of the safest in Dallas.    Car Wash 2) Just 6 miles down the road in city of Duncanville    The Duncanville location has a new Walmart diagonally across from it now (which was formerly vacant land) which has really helped give a boost and continues to help as more people realize the car wash is there. The land previously was vacant for decades. Also, I received notice in the mail last summer that the huge 8+ acres of vacant land across the street of the car wash (west side) is being zoned for commercial, and going to have a strip mall with a grocery store in it.  Not sure on its start-date, but occasionally see surveyors over there.  So this intersection is going to be even busier soon. Obviously once Walmart shows up, other businesses show up.",
